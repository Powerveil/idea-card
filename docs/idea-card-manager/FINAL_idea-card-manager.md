## 1. Project Summary
Successfully implemented a single-page Idea Card Manager using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application meets all requirements including responsive design, data persistence, and rich interactions.

- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts from mobile (1 col) to desktop (auto-fill).
- **Interactions**:
    - Real-time search and filtering.
    - Toast notifications for actions.
    - Markdown rendering (Bold, Italic, Breaks).
    - Edit/Delete/Favorite actions.
- **Architecture**: Single `index.html` file containing:
    - CSS with variables for theming.
    - Semantic HTML structure.
    - Modular JavaScript with State and Event management.

## 3. Usage
- Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
- Data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

## 4. Future Improvements (TODO)
